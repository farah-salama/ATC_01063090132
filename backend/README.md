## Local Development

If you want to run the server locally:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://eventy_user:2ZS7uxEF6ESNmQ8k@cluster0.muqvv.mongodb.net/Eventy?authSource=admin
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=AN_EXTREMELY_secret_key
```
or add your mongodb connection string instead of the given one.

You can use `.env.example` as a reference for the required environment variables.

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`
